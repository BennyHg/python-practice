# Python Practice Problems

---

This collection of practice problems for Python is unit test
driven. That's how you know you're done: when all the tests
pass.

Each problem in _problems/_ has a corresponding test in
_tests/_ and a corresponding solution in _solutions/_.

1. Fork the repository
1. Clone the forked repository
1. Create a branch for your work
1. Run `python -m pytest -k "001"` to see the broken test
1. Open _problems/problem_001.py_ to read the specification
   and fill in the code
1. Run `python -m pytest -k "001"` to see the fixed test
1. Go on to "002" and keep going until you hit "080"

Then, start all over, again!
